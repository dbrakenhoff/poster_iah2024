        The analytic element method (AEM) is a gridless technique for modeling groundwater flow problems in which each feature that affects groundwater flow is described using an analytical solution. Superposition of these solutions can be used to gain insight into complex geohydrological problems. The advantages of AEM are that no spatial or temporal discretization is required and that the locations of elements are exact. The head can be computed at any location and at any time within the model domain. One disadvantage is that the computation of the head requires computing the contribution of each element in the model, causing models with many elements to become somewhat computationally intensive. Though computational solutions exist to mitigate these downsides, finite difference (FD) groundwater models such as Modflow 6 are highly efficient and capable of modeling large-scale heterogeneous groundwater flow problems. However, these numerical groundwater models require both temporal and spatial discretization. This requires the modeler to make choices that fit the problem. In mixed-scale problems, e.g. local head changes in a large aquifer system, trade-offs between computation time and level of detail have to be considered.
        
        \vspace{3mm}

        % In this fashion, a block of finite difference cells is replaced by an AEM model. Both models are solved simultaneously, which satisfies the water balance. Specially developed analytic line-elements facilitate the communication between the two models. Benchmark problems showcase the accuracy of the implementation and the challenges that arise from coupling numerical and analytic models.

        \begin{multicols}{3}

        The coupling of FD and AEM is demonstrated by replacing one cell in the FD model with an analytic element model. An analytic element model of that cell requires the following elements:

        \vspace{3mm}
        
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
            \item boundary elements to control the fluxes in/out of the AEM model
            \item any internal elements that affect groundwater flow (e.g. wells)
            \item and a constant
        \end{itemize}

        \vspace{3mm}
        
        Solving these models simultaneously requires communication between the two models such that the water balance is met.

            \item A simple finite difference model for single confined aquifers was used in the research. The finite difference implementation was programmed in Python. Modflow 6 was not initially used as accessing and modifying the relevant parts of the code was inconvenient at this stage of the  project.

        \begin{multicols}{2}
            
        The boundary elements facilitate the communication between the AEM model and the FD model. The boundary element is set up as general head boundary. The normal flux $q_n$ over the element is uniform but unknown. The flux is driven by the difference between some specified head $h_\text{FD}$ and the mean head along the element $h_m$, multiplied by a conductance term $C$. The conductance is computed from the FD cell midpoint to the cell boundary. 

        \begin{equation}\label{eqn:ghb}
            Q_n = q_n \Delta y \Delta z = C \left( h_\text{FD} - h_m \right) 
        \end{equation}

        \vspace{3mm}
        
        The analytic solution of the boundary element is derived through separation of variables in elliptic coordinates \citep{bakker_derivation_2008}. The solutions for line-sinks and line-doublets are added together as this gave the most accurate results.

            \item the mean head along the boundary elements is substituted into the FD equations

            The wells are both located within one cell in the FD model. The FD model is therefore not able to compute separate capture zones for each well. The coupled FD+AEM model is able to closely match the exact solution, despite the coarse 100 x 100 m resolution of the FD model.

        \begin{multicols}{3}

            An injection and a pumping well of equal magnitude supply and extract water in a confined aquifer at a rate of 150 m$^3$/d. Both wells lie within the same cell in the FD model. The model is bounded by a constant head boundary. The model parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:modelparams}.

            The FD model cannot compute a sensible solution since the net pumping rate within the cell is 0 m$^3$/d. The coupled FD+AEM solution provides a reasonable estimate of the flow-net and the 15-year capture zone compared to the exact solution.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item AEM has potential as an local refinement method for a FD model. The head and flow can be computed at any point within the AEM cell: \ul{infinite refinement of cell!}
        \item Promising early results coupling FD and AEM models for wells in a single confined aquifer.
        \item General head boundary elements are flexible and satisfy the water balance. Using this element it should be straight-forward to replace multiple FD cells with an AEM model. 
        \item AEM code is written in Python and has an object-oriented structure similar to TimML and TTim. Elements developed in this research can be easily integrated into TimML or TTim.
